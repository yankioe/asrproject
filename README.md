# Forced Alignment and Pronunciation Variation in Low-Resource Corpora
Class project for Automatic Speech Recognition, taught by Dr. Gerhard Jäger at the University of Tübingen.

Our project focuses on forced alignment and phonetic analysis of speech data in [Tatar](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tata1255), a low resource language spoken in Tatarstan. We utilize [Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to align speech and text, and analyze variation in pronunciation across different speakers, regions, or age groups.

All sound data courtesy of [Mozilla Commonvoice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets).

## Objectives
- Use forced alignment to generate phoneme or word-level time alignments.

- Analyze pronunciation variation by speaker group or region.

- Evaluate alignment quality manually and via proxy metrics.

- Create a custom G2P lexicon.

## Repository Content
- Alignment pipeline and scripts

- Outsourced data and models

- Final report
