# Forced Alignment for Pronunciation Variation Analysis in Tatar
Class project for Automatic Speech Recognition, taught by Dr. Gerhard Jäger at the University of Tübingen.

Our project focuses on forced alignment and phonetic analysis of speech data in [Tatar](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tata1255), a low resource language spoken in Tatarstan. We utilize [Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to align speech and text, and analyze variation in pronunciation across different speakers, regions, or age groups.

All sound data courtesy of [Mozilla Common Voice](https://datacollective.mozillafoundation.org/datasets).

## Objectives
- Use forced alignment to generate phoneme or word-level time alignments.

- Analyze pronunciation variation by speaker group or region.

- Evaluate alignment quality manually and via proxy metrics.

## Repository Content
- Alignment pipeline and scripts

- Alignment results

- Final report

- Presentation slides
